## 🚀 How It Works

- The computer selects a random number between 1 and 100.
- The user is asked to input a guess.
- The program gives hints:
  - "Number is Greater try again" if the guess is too high.
  - "Number is Smaller try again" if the guess is too low.
- The game continues until the correct number is guessed.
